/// Borderless, click-through, status-bar-level NSPanel that hosts the live
/// caption-bar overlay. By default sits above regular app windows and
/// ignores mouse events so the user can still click through to whatever is
/// below (Teams / Zoom / browser).
///
/// To reposition: hold ⌥ (Option) and drag — the modifier monitor below
/// flips `ignoresMouseEvents` off while the key is held, and the panel
/// (`LiveCaptionsPanel`) moves itself from the mouse events it then
/// receives. It used to lean on `isMovableByWindowBackground`, which on
/// macOS 27 no longer moves a window whose content view is an
/// `NSHostingView` (measured: the same panel with a plain `NSView` still
/// moves, and style mask, level and collection behaviour make no
/// difference); the events still arrive, so the panel does the moving.
/// The post-drag origin is persisted
/// to `UserDefaults` (`liveCaptionsPanelOriginKey`) and a follow-up screen
/// is picked by containing-screen lookup on next launch, so the bar
/// re-appears on the secondary display if that's where the user last
/// parked it.
///
/// Uses a fixed-size panel (no `sizingOptions = .preferredContentSize`)
/// because auto-sizing produced an infinite layout-feedback loop with the
/// caption-bar content — the SwiftUI hierarchy's ideal size republished on
/// every layout pass, NSHostingController called `setFrame`, which fired
/// another layout, recursing until the stack overflowed. The fixed-size
/// trade-off: very long captions clip vertically once they exceed the
/// preset's panel height; that's acceptable for the PoC and the surrounding
/// overlay only renders a few lines anyway. The dimensions come from
/// `LiveCaptionsSize` (Settings → Transcription → Caption size), which pairs
/// each panel size with the font it was measured for; `apply(size:)` swaps
/// both together.
