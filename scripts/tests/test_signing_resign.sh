# Regression test for the deployed-bundle re-sign in scripts/lib/signing.sh.
#
# Bug history (issue #609):
#   Every e2e lane deploys the dev bundle to a stable path and re-signs it with a
#   stable identity, so TCC keeps its grants across rebuilds. That re-sign was a
#   bare `codesign --force --sign X "$bundle"`, and a signature written that way
#   carries NO entitlements at all — which is why the build's own "Verified
#   com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive survived signing" line
#   was printed one step before the key was thrown away again. The microphone
#   entitlement went with it.
#
#   It also left the bundle INCOHERENT: the embedded provisioning profile
#   survived (rsync copies it in) while the entitlement it authorises did not,
#   which is the exact pairing scripts/e2e-browser.sh asserts — so the lane
#   failed pointing at prepare_signing, which had done its job correctly.
#
# Real codesign wherever the assertion is about a real signature (ad-hoc signing
# needs no certificate, so this runs on a contributor's machine too); a
# PATH-stubbed codesign only for the case that needs a bundle signed by a
# certificate nobody can be assumed to hold.
