# E2E test for the silent-recording detector — the failure mode that shipped
# past PR #286 unnoticed (40 min Teams call → both channels at noise floor →
# no in-app warning).
#
# Unlike scripts/e2e-channel-health.sh, this driver does NOT use a debug
# env-hook to set the observable directly. Instead it:
#   1. Launches the dev .app with autoWatch enabled (via defaults write).
#   2. Launches tools/meeting-simulator with --silent → window with a
#      MeetingDetector-matching title pops, but no audio is played.
#   3. The app's MeetingDetector / PowerAssertionDetector picks up the
#      simulator, WatchLoop transitions to .recording, the recorder taps
#      the (silent) system output + mic.
#   4. AppState's 10-Hz polling task feeds the (-120, -120) readings into
#      SilentRecordingMonitor.
#   5. After `asymmetricSilenceWarningSeconds` of sustained both-silent,
#      .started fires → `recordingSilentActive = true`.
#   6. This script polls `/state.channelHealth.recordingSilent` via the
#      RPC server and asserts true.
#
# Crucially, reverting `activeRecorder = recorder` in `WatchLoop.handleMeeting`
# OR removing the `silentRecordingMonitor.update(...)` wiring in AppState
# will make this assertion fail — that's the contract this e2e enforces:
# the full production chain must work end-to-end.
#
# Runs on:
#   - Any macOS host with auto-login + an Aqua GUI session (for the
#     meeting-simulator window to be visible to CATapDescription)
#   - Self-hosted Mac mini with BlackHole 2ch as default input (so the mic
#     side is genuinely silent under the synthetic meeting)
#
# Usage: bash scripts/e2e-silent-recording.sh [--no-build]

# --- 2. Snapshot the defaults this lane overrides ---------------------------

# redirected into the app's container once containermanagerd has registered
# one for the identifier, and the dev .app is not sandboxed, so it resolves
# the standard domain. Reading and restoring the wrong one silently leaks this
# lane's 30 s threshold into whatever runs next, or leaves the app on its
# built-in 90 s while the lane waits 50 s for a flag that cannot flip in time.
#
# The snapshot runs BEFORE the quit below for a reason that has nothing to do
# with preferences and everything to do with the exit trap. `quit_running_app`
# is bare under `set -e`, so an exhausted quit ladder exits the script straight
# into `cleanup` with every SAVED_* still empty, and an empty snapshot restores
# by DELETING the key. Snapshotting first means the trap can never delete a
# developer's real settings that this lane never read.
#
# The writes still run after the quit, which is defensive rather than measured:
# a live instance owning the same domain did NOT clobber an external write in
# testing on macOS 26, but nothing is gained by writing underneath a process
# that is about to be killed anyway.
