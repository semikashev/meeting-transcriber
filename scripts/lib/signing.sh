# Shared signing helper: embed a provisioning profile and, only then, add the
# entitlements that profile authorises.
#
# Why this exists (issue #543): the browser-meeting consent prompt asks a
# question that expires. At the default interruption level macOS renders it as a
# banner, which any Focus mode suppresses outright, so the question is never seen
# and browser meetings silently never record. `.timeSensitive` is the only level
# that breaks through Focus, and it requires
# `com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive`.
#
# That entitlement is RESTRICTED. Measured, not assumed: signing a bundle with it
# but no provisioning profile makes macOS refuse to launch the app outright
# ("Launchd job spawn failed", POSIX 163) — with a local Apple Development cert
# AND with Developer ID plus hardened runtime, i.e. exactly how a release is
# signed. Adding the key unconditionally would ship a brick.
#
# So the key is added ONLY when a profile that authorises it is present, and the
# no-profile path is byte-identical to the previous behaviour. Contributors and
# CI without profiles keep building working apps; the prompt just stays at the
# old interruption level for them.
#
# Profiles are Developer ID distribution profiles from the Apple Developer
# portal, one per bundle id. They are gitignored: they are account artifacts, and
# the same reasoning that keeps the signing certificate out of the repo applies.
# Point PROFILE_DIR somewhere else if you keep them elsewhere.

#                            that means for the bundle is each caller's call
#   CHOSEN_IDENTITY_REASON   the rule that chose it, one phrase for the log
#   CHOSEN_IDENTITY_LISTING  its `security find-identity` line(s), leading
#                            whitespace removed, so the log can name the
#                            certificate instead of only hashing it
#
# Globals rather than stdout, as with prepare_signing: three values, and one
# keychain query behind all of them.
#
# Call it BEFORE the bundle is touched. The certificate of the previous build
# lives in the main executable's embedded signature, and copying a freshly
# linked binary over that executable leaves an ad-hoc signature with no
# certificate in it. Measured: the intact bundle yields the hash, the same
# bundle after the copy yields nothing. Called after the copy this function is
# not wrong, only blind: it can never take rule 1 and falls through to rules 2
# and 3, which costs the renewal case described at rule 1 and, on a keychain
# without a Developer ID, moves a bundle whose certificate was fine to
# whatever happens to be listed first.
#
# TCC binds a grant to the signing certificate's leaf SHA-1, so the choice made
# here decides whether the dev app keeps its microphone and screen-recording
# grants or silently loses all of them: the rebuilt app then records nothing,
# with no error anywhere and no prompt, because from TCC's point of view it is
# a different application. `head -1` over the keychain made that depend on
# listing order, and the order changed under us the day an Apple Development
# certificate was added. Hence, in order:
#
#   1. Keep the certificate the bundle already carries, while it is still in
#      the keychain AND it is either a Developer ID one or there is no
#      Developer ID to move to. Two valid Developer ID Application
#      certificates (the overlap around a renewal) would otherwise put us back
#      to "whichever is listed first", and switching between them voids the
#      grants just as thoroughly as switching issuer would. The second half of
#      the condition matters: a bundle signed with Apple Development before
#      this rule existed would be pinned to the wrong certificate forever by
#      "keep what is there" alone, with the only escape being to delete the
#      bundle by hand. With it, such a bundle moves to Developer ID by itself.
#   2. Otherwise the Developer ID Application certificate, the one the grants
#      on a maintainer's machine were made against.
#   3. Otherwise the first identity listed, with a note that grants made
#      against a different certificate will not apply. A self-hosted runner
#      holding only its self-signed certificate lands here; its lanes re-sign
#      the deployed copy with dev_signing_identity anyway, so this choice
#      decides nothing there.
#
# The identities are read through codesigning_identities, identity_fields and
# first_developer_id below, so this and prepare_signing answer "which one is
# the Developer ID" the same way.

# call:
#
#   - `codesign --force --sign X "$bundle"` with no `--entitlements` writes a
#     signature carrying NO entitlements at all. That is how the e2e lanes used
#     to drop the microphone entitlement and — where a profile had authorised it
#     — the time-sensitive one, one step after the build verified it survived.
#   - The key cannot simply be re-requested here, because a profile authorises
#     specific CERTIFICATES and macOS refuses to launch a bundle whose restricted
#     entitlement no embedded profile covers (see this file's header).
#
# So a bundle whose VALID signature is already by the requested certificate is
# left alone — re-signing it could only subtract — and otherwise the bundle is
# re-signed with the base entitlements, dropping a profile the new signature
# cannot honour. That last part matters: a profile left embedded next to a missing
# key is what makes e2e-browser.sh's pairing check fail while pointing at
# prepare_signing, which did its job correctly.
#
# Validity is part of the question, not a detail. The certificate is read from
# the executable's own signature and says who signed it, not that the bundle
# still matches what was signed: anything changed under the seal afterwards, a
# resource or the plist, leaves the certificate readable and the signature
# invalid, and keeping it would launch a bundle macOS refuses to run.
# (test_rpc.sh's copy of a fresh binary into the signed bundle is NOT that
# case: the copy replaces the very executable the certificate is read from,
# so bundle_signing_cert_sha1 answers nothing and the hash comparison alone
# sends it to the re-sign. Measured: after the copy `codesign -d` reports an
# ad-hoc signature and extracts no certificate, and `--verify` fails with
