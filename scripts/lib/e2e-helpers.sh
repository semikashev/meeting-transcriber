# Probe-then-sleep: an already-true condition returns on the first tick,
# and one final probe runs right before the deadline check.

# absent or present, container present or absent, and a live client that does
# its own set plus synchronize after an external write. No failure window, so
# this is not a race the lanes keep winning by luck.

# `defaults write <bundle-id>` is deliberately NOT used. cfprefsd redirects it
# into the app's container, and the trigger is a container that

# existing: creating the path by hand does not redirect, and `rm -rf` of a
# registered container stops the redirect without the directory coming back.
# That removal is the operational cure on a host that has one. What created the
# container on the runner is NOT established, and it was not this repo:
# build_release.sh signs even the App Store variant with the release
# identifier, and that workflow runs on a GitHub-hosted image.

# creates one. Feeding a domain nothing reads would leave a future sandboxed
# build under this identifier starting up with a test lane's settings.
