# Live-recording E2E driver for the Meeting Transcriber dev app.
#
# Builds the dev .app, deploys it to a stable path so its TCC permissions
# persist across runs, launches it, triggers a synthetic meeting via the
# meeting-simulator tool, polls the DebugRPCServer for the resulting
# pipeline job, and asserts on the transcript output.
#
# This is the production-app E2E path, intentionally separate from the
# fixture-based component E2E tests in `app/MeetingTranscriber/Tests/*E2E*.swift`
# (which run on PR-CI). Rationale and history: see CLAUDE.md > E2E architecture.
#
# Prerequisites on the runner host (one-time setup):
#   - Xcode at /Applications/Xcode.app (xcode-select pointed there)
#   - GUI session for the runner user (CATapDescription needs a logged-in
#     loginwindow context — service-mode runners get silent audio capture)
#   - A virtual input device (BlackHole 2ch) so AVAudioEngine has something
#     to bind to on Mac mini hosts without a built-in mic
#   - System Settings → Privacy: Microphone + Screen & System Audio Recording
#     granted to ~/Applications/MeetingTranscriber-Dev.app
#   See scripts/setup-self-hosted-runner.sh for the bootstrap flow.

Usage: e2e-app.sh [--no-build] [--keep-app] [--two-meetings] [--record-only]
                  [--reimport-recorded | --reimport-latest] [--keep-recordings]
                  [--naming-escape] [--naming-switch] [--echo-bleed] [--echo-cancel]
                  [--naming-confirm] [--fixture path/to.wav]

  --no-build           Skip build/deploy/re-sign; use ~/Applications/MeetingTranscriber-Dev.app as-is.
  --keep-app           Leave the dev app running on exit. Default: quit it.
  --two-meetings       Run two meetings back-to-back (cooldown + state-reset coverage).
  --mic-only           Record the microphone with no app audio (issue #633) via
                       POST /v1/record, and assert the sidecar carries a mic track
                       and NO app track. Reroutes the default OUTPUT to BlackHole
                       2ch for the lane's duration so the loopback input has
                       something to hear, and restores it on any exit.
  --record-only        Enable record-only mode: assert on sidecar JSON + mix WAV instead
                       of transcript/protocol. Exercises the WatchLoop branch that
                       skips VAD/transcription/diarization/protocol generation.
  --reimport-recorded  Chain a record-only meeting with a re-import via the
                       POST /action/enqueueFile RPC: capture audio live, write
                       a WAV, then feed that WAV back in through the "Open from
                       Recording" pipeline and assert the transcript. Covers
                       both the recorder's WAV-encoding correctness and the
                       AudioMixer 3-tier file-load fallback in one pass.
                       Self-contained — no prior run required.
  --reimport-latest    Skip the live-record phase and re-import the freshest
                       *_mix.wav already in ~/Downloads/MeetingTranscriber/recordings/.
                       Pair with a previous `--record-only --keep-recordings`
                       run (CI uses this to chain steps without re-recording;
                       locally also useful for silent fast iteration on the
                       import pipeline).
  --keep-recordings    Suppress the on-exit cleanup of record-only output, so
                       a follow-up --reimport-latest can pick the WAV up.
                       Only meaningful with --record-only.
  --mic-device-change  Build with the issue #379 fault-injection seam
                       (-DE2E_FAULT_INJECTION) and run one meeting. The app
                       self-triggers a mic device-change restart mid-recording
                       that installs the tap with an invalid format — the
                       condition that raises an uncatchable NSException from
                       installTapOnBus. Asserts the app SURVIVES (no SIGABRT)
                       and the recording still completes. Pre-fix this crashes;
                       the fix must catch + recover. Requires a build (incompatible
                       with --no-build).
  --crash-recovery     Issue #379 part 3: start a meeting, wait until the
                       recorder is writing its raw app temp, then SIGKILL the
                       app mid-recording (no stop() -> the raw _app16k_raw.tmp +
                       unfinalized _mic.wav survive, no _mix.wav). Relaunch and
                       assert the recovered recording enters the pipeline and a
                       job reaches done (the re-mixed _mix.wav is transient — the
                       pipeline consumes it into its workdir within seconds).
                       Pre-fix the launch cleanup deletes the temp -> no
                       recovery (RED); the fix re-mixes + enqueues it (GREEN).
  --redeploy-only      Rebuild + redeploy the canonical (non-fault-injection)
                       bundle to ~/Applications/MeetingTranscriber-Dev.app and
                       exit without launching or running a meeting. Used as an
                       always() cleanup after --mic-device-change to restore a
                       clean bundle (that run leaves a deliberately-crashing
                       fault-injection build deployed). Requires a build
                       (incompatible with --no-build and --mic-device-change).
  --naming-confirm     Drive the speaker-naming CONFIRM path end-to-end. Enqueues
                       the 2-speaker fixture with diarization on and expected
                       speakers = 2 via POST /v1/jobs, waits for the job to park
                       at speaker-naming (does NOT auto-skip like the other
                       lanes), reads GET /v1/jobs/<id>/naming, POSTs an anonymous
                       Speaker A / Speaker B mapping, then asserts the confirmed
                       names land as transcript speaker labels, the raw
                       diarization labels are gone, and the speaker DB learned the
                       voices. Standalone lane (incompatible with the other lane
                       flags). Under CI it snapshots + restores the runner's real
                       speakers.json / recognition_log.jsonl so confirming never
                       pollutes the persistent speaker DB; that snapshot/restore
                       is $GITHUB_ACTIONS-gated, so a LOCAL run enrolls voices
                       into your real speaker DB (a warning is printed).
  --naming-switch      Issue #700: type into the naming dialog after it switches
                       to the next pending job of the same meeting title. Two
                       dual-source pairs are imported with one stem (so both jobs
                       are dual-source and share a title); expected speakers is
                       pinned to 1 so the app track yields exactly one remote (R_)
                       cluster, while the mic tracks cluster into several speakers
                       on the first job and one on the second, which moves the
                       surviving R_ label to a lower row. The lane asserts that
                       geometry, then (with BOTH jobs still pending) switches the
                       dialog's segmented job picker to the second job so the same
                       view is reused, posts real keystrokes into the surviving R_
                       field from outside the process, and asserts the app is
                       still alive, the text landed in that row and nowhere else,
                       and a Confirm enrolls that name into the speaker DB (read
                       over RPC). Pre-fix the first keystroke trapped
                       Array._checkSubscript_mutating and killed the app. Needs
                       the Accessibility grant (see the e2e-architecture skill);
                       without it the lane skips loudly and passes. Standalone
                       lane; ignores --fixture (rejected). Needs python3 + swiftc.
  --title-source       Issue #501: run meeting-simulator with a window title equal
                       to the app name (no usable meeting-window title), then assert
                       the detected meeting title is the clean "MeetingSimulator Call"
                       placeholder — not the raw IOKit assertion name. Fails against
                       the pre-fix detector, so it proves the deployed
                       detection → title-selection chain end-to-end.
  --echo-bleed         Assert the echo-bleed verdict end to end. Synthesises two
                       dual-source pairs from the shipped fixtures — one whose
                       microphone track carries the app track back from the
                       loudspeaker, one clean control differing by exactly that
                       term — enqueues each via POST /v1/jobs, and asserts the
                       verdict on GET /v1/jobs/<id>: detected on the affected
                       pair, present-and-false on the control. The control is
                       what keeps the lane from passing on a detector that says
                       yes to everything. Standalone lane. Needs python3.
                       Leaves two finished jobs and a recognition-log row behind
                       (it skips their naming so nothing stays parked); it never
                       enrolls a voice, so speakers.json is untouched.
  --echo-cancel        The other half of --echo-bleed: run the same two pairs with
                       echo cancellation ON and assert the far end is taken out of
                       the microphone AUDIO rather than out of the transcript after
                       the fact. Asserts removed=true on the affected pair, absent
                       on the control (nobody tried, which is not the same as
                       tried and failed), and zero suppressed segments on the
                       affected pair with the dedup still switched on — that last
                       one is the precedence, not a coincidence. Its pairs carry a
                       far end that pauses, because the canceller's self-check is a
                       difference between the windows where the far end played and
                       the windows where it did not. Standalone lane. Needs python3
                       and the bundled model.
  --fixture            Audio fixture for meeting-simulator. Default: two_speakers_de.wav.
  --quit-foreign-app   Outside CI the driver refuses to start while a dev app it did
                       not launch is running (someone may be using it). Pass this
                       to quit and relaunch it instead, when you know it is yours.

# --- Mic-only lane: audio routing ------------------------------------------
#
# The lane needs one invariant that no default configuration guarantees: the
# default INPUT must be a loopback of the default OUTPUT, so that playing a
# fixture is the same as speaking into the microphone. It arranges the second
# half itself, pointing the default output at the loopback device for its own
# duration, and asserts the first half in its preflight rather than assuming it.
#
# Why it is needed at all, measured 2026-08-18: with the output on the speakers,
# four mic tracks sampled from earlier runs on this host each read -120 dBFS
# (a sample, not a census), while the analyzer reports -22 dBFS for the shipped
# fixture. With the output routed into the loopback this lane records -22 dBFS.
# The app track is unaffected either way because it comes from the CATap, which
# reads process output and touches no device at all.
#
# Restoring the routing matters more than setting it. A machine left on the
# loopback goes silent AND records, on every later dual-source lane, a mic track
# that is a bit-perfect copy of the app track. That is textbook echo bleed: it
# would skew the echo detector on runs that have nothing to do with this lane,
# and no lane asserts against it, so CI would stay green while the meaning of
# every recording quietly changed. Hence:
#
#   - the marker is written BEFORE the switch, so a kill can never strand the
#     machine with no record of where to go back to;
#   - it is deleted only AFTER the restore has been verified by re-reading the
#     device, so a restore that fails keeps its own repair instructions;
#   - it carries the owning PID, so a concurrent run heals a dead run's marker
#     and never steals a live one;
#   - the self-heal runs before every early exit, not just before the lane.

# Application Support, via AppPaths). Left unmanaged that would permanently
# pollute the Mac mini runner's persistent speaker DB, which the
# Sortformer-naming lane's recognition expectations depend on. Snapshot both
# files before the lane and restore them from the exit trap (success AND
# failure). The snapshot also resets speakers.json to empty so the fixture's
# voices are guaranteed UNMATCHED, the clean precondition the transcript
# relabel assertion relies on (auto-name == raw SPEAKER_n label).
#
# GUARDED to CI via `$GITHUB_ACTIONS` (never set in a developer's shell), like

# Speaker-naming CONFIRM lane. Every other lane's shared poll loop auto-skips
# each naming dialog (POST /action/skipNaming), so the confirm path (assign
# names → the names land as transcript speaker labels → the speaker DB learns
# the voices) has ZERO live coverage. That path is exactly the bug family the
# late-rerun transcript-rebuild fix addressed (a confirm that renamed labels but
# never re-segmented the persisted .txt), so it needs a standing regression net.
#
# Suppression of the auto-skip is scoped to this lane BY CONSTRUCTION: it drives
# the whole flow itself (enqueue → poll pendingNamingJobs → GET/POST
# /v1/jobs/<id>/naming → poll the job to done) and never calls
# `_poll_for_new_lastjob_terminal`, so the global auto-skip other lanes rely on
# is untouched.
# --- Escape-dismisses-naming lane (issue #577) ----------------------------
# Presses a REAL Escape on the open speaker-naming dialog and asserts the one
# thing the fix is about: the window goes away and the job does NOT resolve.
#
# Why a WindowServer keystroke and not an RPC endpoint. A synthetic NSEvent
# cannot do this: keycode 53 only becomes `cancelOperation:` inside
# `interpretKeyEvents:`, which only text-input responders call, so with no name
# field focused SwiftUI's exit command never sees it. Measured three ways (both
# NSWindow.sendEvent and NSApplication.sendEvent in the live app, plus xctest)
# — every one reports a clean dispatch and changes nothing, which is why an
# in-process endpoint for this was built, found inert, and reverted.
#
# Deliberately does NOT click into a name field first. The dialog binds dismiss
# twice — `onExitCommand` for the focused case and a `.cancelAction` carrier for
# the rest — and it is the unfocused path that the fix nearly shipped broken,
# so that is the one worth a lane.
#
# RUNNER PREREQUISITE: the shell running this needs an Accessibility grant
# (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility), same one-time,
# cert-independent shape as the existing mic / screen-recording grants. Checked
# up front so a missing grant fails with its own message instead of looking like
# a broken dismiss.

# --- Speaker-naming switch lane (issue #700) -------------------------------
#
# Types into the naming dialog AFTER it has switched to the next pending job of
# the same meeting title. The window keeps one view for both jobs because its
# identity is the title, and the mic track's cluster count differs between the
# jobs, so a remote label that survives the switch sits at a lower row than
# before. That is the geometry that reproduced the issue #700 crash: the field
# a surviving label keeps must carry the user's typing to that label and no
# other. See issue #700 for the defect this guards against.
#
# The switch is done via the dialog's segmented job picker while BOTH jobs are
# still pending ("while the second dialog is showing", in the reporter's words),
# NOT by resolving the first job. This matters and was measured: resolving the
# first drops the picker (count 2 -> 1), which shifts the SpeakerNamingView's
# structural slot in its VStack and makes SwiftUI rebuild it with FRESH fields,
# so the reused view under test is never exercised. Keeping both jobs pending
# keeps the picker present and the view reused, which is what the lane needs.
#
# Two dual-source pairs are enqueued through the same paired import a fleet
# consumer uses, so both jobs are genuinely dual-source (`M_`/`R_` labels) and
# both carry the stem as their title. The app side is pinned to exactly one
# remote cluster through the "expected speakers" setting (it applies to the app
# track only; the mic track always auto-detects), and the mic tracks are chosen
# so the first job clusters into several `M_` speakers and the second into one.
# The resulting positions are ASSERTED before anything is typed: the lane fails
# as "geometry not staged" rather than passing vacuously if the diarizer ever
# hears the fixtures differently.
#
# Why a paired import and not two live recordings. The defect lives in the
# dialog, not in the recorder, and every other lane here covers the recorder. A
# live recording starts only once the meeting is detected, so the mic fixture's
# opening seconds are lost, and how much is lost varies run to run; that is
# exactly the part that decides how many clusters the diarizer hears. The import
# feeds the diarizer the same samples every time.
#
# The keystroke is a real WindowServer key event from outside the process,
# because the naming window is off the in-process /ui/type allowlist (PII). It
# goes through scripts/drive-naming-field.swift, which needs only the
# Accessibility grant the --naming-escape lane already requires; that file says
# why System Events (which would also need Automation) is not used.
# RUNNER PREREQUISITE: the Accessibility grant from the e2e-architecture skill's
# runner setup. Missing, the lane skips loudly and passes, like --naming-escape.

# --- echo-bleed lane ------------------------------------------------------
#
# A dual-source recording made on loudspeakers carries the remote voices on the
# microphone track too, so the same speech is transcribed twice and lands in the
# transcript twice. The pipeline measures that before transcription and reports
# the verdict on GET /v1/jobs/<id>. This lane drives that chain in the deployed
# app: synthesise a pair, enqueue it, read the verdict back.
#
# It cannot record the condition live. The runner is a Mac mini with no
# microphone, only a virtual input device, so there is no acoustic path for a
# loudspeaker to bleed through. The synthesised pair is the better instrument
# anyway: it makes the expected verdict exact instead of a property of the room.
#
# TWO pairs are enqueued, differing by exactly one term. Without the clean
# control the lane would stay green against a detector that answers yes to
# everything, which is the failure mode that actually matters here — a false
# positive tells the user their recording is broken when it is not.
#
# No settings are touched. The verdict does not depend on any of them, so a lane
# that mutates the runner's defaults would add a restore path and a way to leave
# the host dirty for nothing.
# The parts of the two echo lanes' fixture setup that are the same lane to lane:
# where the generator and its two source recordings live, and a fresh directory
# to put the output in. What the generator is ASKED for stays at each lane's own
# call site, because that is the one thing they differ in and hiding it behind a
# passthrough would cost more than the two lines it saves.
#
# Shared rather than copied for a reason this change learned the hard way: the
# two functions held these lines verbatim, and an edit anchored on text that
# appears in both landed in the wrong one and broke a lane that had been green
# for weeks.
# Separate directories per pair. The resolver groups on directory AND stem, so
# this keeps the two pairs apart no matter what stem names are chosen.

# --- echo-cancellation lane -------------------------------------------------
#
# The other half of --echo-bleed. That lane proves the far end is left out of
# the TRANSCRIPT after the fact; this one proves it is taken out of the
# microphone AUDIO before anything reads it, which is what also keeps it out of
# the mic track's diarization and out of the speaker embeddings taken from it.
#
# Its pairs differ from that lane's in one term: the far end pauses. That is not
# a convenience. The canceller's self-check is a DIFFERENCE between the windows
# where the far end was playing and the windows where it was not, so a fixture
# whose far end never stops offers no control group and the shipped check
# refuses to confirm the run — measured on the other lane's pair, which splits
# 42 windows to 8 against a floor of 10 on each side and comes back unjudgeable
# however well the run went. Gated 2.5 s on / 2.5 s off it splits 25 to 25.
#
# The dedup stays ON for this lane, deliberately. Both remedies asked for at
# once is the configuration where precedence is a decision rather than a
# formality, and zero suppressed segments on a pair the other lane strips four
# from is what proves cancellation took it.

# Asserts the deployed bundle carries the model before anything is enqueued.
# Without it the stage reports "the model is missing" and leaves the track as
# recorded, which is correct behaviour and a failure of this lane, but one that
# reads as a broken canceller unless it is named here.
#
# The pattern comes from the library that installs it, so the convention has one
# owner; the concrete filename is nobody's business here, which is what keeps a
# model bump to a single edit.
#
# NOT the app's own `--localvqe-selftest`, which would be the deeper check: it
# goes through the production resolver and would also catch a model that is
# present and does not load. Tried, and it hangs in exactly the situation this
# precondition exists for. A bundle old enough to lack the model is usually old
# enough to lack the flag, and an unrecognised argument does not fail, it starts
# the menu-bar app, which never exits. Measured against a deployed bundle from a
# fortnight earlier: no output, no exit, killed after two minutes. A precondition
# that can hold the runner for a whole step budget is worse than one that
# under-checks, and the case it would add is caught by the lane's own assertion,
# where the job's warnings name it.
